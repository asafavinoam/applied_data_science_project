    "\n",
    "Additional datasets -\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"UK football stadiums\" -  [UK stadiums description](https://www.doogal.co.uk/FootballStadiums.php//) \n",
    "- Position in league table per stage - from [worldfootball](https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule//)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"European Soccer Database\" consists of three main tables:\n",
    "- Match - features for each match of 2008-2016 seasons\n",
    "- Player -  player attributes\n",
    "- Team - team attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The worldfootball dataset was extracted directly from the website. In order to receive the position of each team in each stage of the league we wrote a script named extract_table_from_url(attached together with this file) which goes through pages such as [this](http://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/eng-premier-league-2016-2017-spieltag/9/) and write the data to an csv file. \n",

    "### EDA update \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we worked on three issues:\n",
    "1) Engineering new features \n",
    "2) Dealing with draw class poor prediction rates\n",
    "3) Using Different classification models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New features:\n",
    "- points - number of points in current league stage\n",
    "- norm_points - number of points in current league stage relative to highest number of points in current stage\n",
    "- position - position in league table\n",
    "- straight_wins - if last game was won, number of wins in a row\n",
    "- straight_loses - if last game was lost, number of losses in a row\n",
    "- straight_draws - - if last game ended with a draw, number of draws in a row \n",
    "- pos_goals - goals scored in last X games\n",
    "- neg_goals - goals received in last X games\n",
    "- tot_pos_goals - goals scored since the begining of the season\n",
    "- tot_neg_goals - goals received since the begining of the season\n",
    "- goals_diff - tot_pos_goals minus tot_neg_goals\n",
    "- wins - wins in last X games \n",
    "- loses - loses in last X games\n",
    "\n",
    "X is the size of the moving window we used.\n",
    "In this file we set X to be 5, in the future we will try different size for X.\n",
    "All of these features were created for both home and away team for each match. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Draw class:\n",
    "As we saw on our first attempt classifier, the classifier never chose the draw class, to deal with this issue we tried two methods, both based on demanding a certain threshold crossing for a win/ lose decision:\n",
    "1) relative threshold - the threshold is determined on the percentage win and lose cases takes out of 1.\n",
    "2) absolute threshold -  win/lose classed needs to cross a predetermined threshold in order for them to be picked\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification models:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a perspective of the preformance we can achive, we tried using the following models:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- KNN\n",
    "- SVM\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- A combination of all models\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying all of these models the best f1-score was received using Logistic Regression with the second type of threshold.\n",
